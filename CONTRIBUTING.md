# Contributing

This project follows the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification.

When opening a pull request, choose one of two strategies:

- **Squashable PR**: Use a Conventional Commit style title for the pull request so the entire branch can be squashed.
- **Rebaseable PR**: Ensure every commit in the feature branch uses a Conventional Commit message.

Either approach keeps the commit history clean and consistent.
